## Abstract
India is an agro-based economy and proper
information about agricultural practices is the key to optimal
agricultural growth and output. In order to answer the queries
of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based on
the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust
enough to answer queries related to weather, market rates,
plant protection and government schemes. This system is
available 24\*7, can be accessed through any electronic device
and the information is delivered with the ease of
understanding. The system is based on a sentence embedding
model which gives an accuracy of 56%. After eliminating
synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy
jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress
towards easier information about farming related practices
and hence a better agricultural output. The job of the Call
Center workforce would be made easier and the hard work of
various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.
